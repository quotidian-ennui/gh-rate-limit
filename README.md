# gh-approve-deploy

This is an extension for [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) that just shows you your existing rate limits and when
it resets

It is exactly the same as doing
```
curl -fSsL -H "Authorization: token $(github_pat)" -X GET \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit \
  | jq '.rate | { "limit": .limit, "remaining" : .remaining  , "resets" : .reset | strflocaltime("%H:%M:%S") }'
```

Marginally useful but not very interesting.

## Installation
